There are two players, one on the left side, one on the right side. Both are able to
jump, and when they are flying, gravity brings them back to the floor. While they are
flying, they have to throw a heart to each other and catch the heart. The obstacle is 
the flying cow, that neutralizes the heart. If the players hit the cow 5 times, they
can get 2 extra points, when they hit the cow inbetween 2 seconds. 

Beware: From time to time there is a bird flying, when a player chrashes into it, the
score is set to zero! 

Very nice for a (wedding) party with dance mats :D

Dedicated to Laura and Ramy, for their wedding in may '23!
